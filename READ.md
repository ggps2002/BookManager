Hello !! I'm pleased that you cared to visit this repo...

ABOUT ME:

I'm a BTech student pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering at National Institute of Technology, Silchar.
I'm an enthusiast Web Developer always excited to create user-friendly scalable apps and build technology that serves a purpose.

ABOUT THE APP:

    People who read books might know how difficult it to organize all that information through reading in our brain and often forgets what that book was actually about (only remembers the discrete pieces).Well our app resolves that, where you kan sign in save the book information so that you don't have to go through the books again .You can just read the short description or the consice summary that you saved whenever and wherever you want.

    Technologies Used:

        Frontend : React, HTML, CSS, Javascript, TailwindCSS, MUI icons, Bootstrap;
        Backend : NodeJS, ExpressJS, PostgreSQL, REST API, passport(for saving sessions and cookies), GoogleOAUTH(for google token based       authentication)
    
    How to get started:

        1. Head over to Backend folder: --> cd Backend
            1. Then run command -->  npm i  (to download all the Nodemodules).
            2. Then run command -->  nodemon server.js (if you don't have nodemon run --> [node server.js] instead) 
        
        2. Ater That head over to the Frontend folder: --> cd Frontend
            1. Then run command -->  npm i  (to download all the Nodemodules).
            2. Then run command -->  npm run dev (to start the react app).
